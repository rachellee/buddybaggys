			I came up with Buddy Baggys when I was walking him one day and the poop bag holder got soaking wet from the ran, causing all the bags inside to get wet as well. I decided I was sick of carrying around wet bags. blah blah blah.<BR /><BR />
			I hope you love Buddy Baggys as much as I do!

			My boyfriend and I adopted Buddy when he was 3 months old from our local Humane Society.<BR /><BR />
			Buddy is an adorable Heinz 57 pup who loves chasing squirrels, visiting the dog park, and taking long, furry naps on the nicest rug in the house.<BR /><BR />
			He is the inspiration behind Buddy Baggys and the best dog I could have asked for.
