			Full-time marketer and dog lover.<BR /><BR />
			Part-time innovator and perpetual DIY-er.<BR /><BR />
			Like most inventions, Buddy Baggys were born out of necessity.
			One day on a walk with my dog I realized we were trailing about
			6 feet of poop bags out of the broken plastic dispenser.
			After some research, a little experimentation, and a lot of
			buttons, Buddy Baggys were born! I hope you love them as much as I do!

			We adopted Buddy from the local shelter just after his first birthday.<BR /><BR />
			Buddy is an adorable Heinz 57 pup who loves chasing squirrels, visiting the dog park,
			and taking long, furry naps on the nicest rug in the house.
			He is the inspiration behind Buddy Baggys and in my unbiased opinion, the best dog ever.
