			I've always loved sewing, but I never expected to build a company around one of my inventions.<BR /><BR />
			Like most inventions, Doo Dog was born out of necessity.
			Back in 2012, I was on a walk with Buddy one day when I realized we were trailing
			6 feet of poop bags out of my broken plastic dispenser.
			Since then, I've been on a mission to design the sturdiest dog bag dispenser that is also environmentally friendly.<BR><BR>
			I've experimented with cotton, hemp, seatbelts, and have bought poo bags of all sizes.<BR>
			After 100s of iterations (and a lot of buttons!) Doo Dog was born!<BR><BR>
			I hope you love them as much as I do!

			We adopted Buddy from the local shelter just after his first birthday.<BR /><BR />
			Buddy is an adorable Heinz 57 pup who loves chasing squirrels, visiting the dog park,
			and taking long, furry naps on the nicest rug in the house.
			He is the inspiration behind Doo Dog and in my unbiased opinion, the best dog ever.
